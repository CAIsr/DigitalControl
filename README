Digital Control (Mac)
=============

Digital Remote Control Application is an open source MAC application which allows the user to take control of photography remotely. The original idea of this application is for serial block-face imaging (generate high resolution three-dimensional images from brain sample) but the application is not limited to other purpose. This application required a server which is also developed by Centre for Advanced Imaging. Please refer to following link (BananaCam): https://github.com/OliverNicolini/BananaCam
<BR/><BR/>
Note: Current version is only supported by USB 2.0. There is an issue with USB 3.0 (libusb support issue in BananaCam). In order to make it works, please connect your Camera to your computer using USB 2.0 then run BananaCam before start up Digital Control.

## Interface
The interface contents several key environments. Centre penal is a main control interface for cameras. It contents base control and liveview support. Left penal is a message (log) penal. It provides information and log to users while triggering any camera functions. Right penal is a file and image viewer. It shows image location and provides based image editor.
